# todo_app

Todo app project build with flutter.

## Getting Started

This is a very basic project in which i have used reorderable list view and Dismissible for giving the swipe effect and reordering the todo list items.
For storing database i have used firebase realtime database (https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_database).
